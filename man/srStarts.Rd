\description{
Finds reasonable starting values for parameters in specific parameterizations of the \dQuote{Beverton-Holt}, \dQuote{Ricker},  \dQuote{Shepherd}, or \dQuote{Saila-Lorda} stock-recruitment models.  Type \code{srModels()} for the equations of each model.
}
\details{
This function attempts to find reasonable starting values for a variety of parameterizations of the \dQuote{Beverton-Holt}, \dQuote{Ricker},  \dQuote{Shepherd}, or \dQuote{Saila-Lorda} stock-recruitment models.  There is no guarantee that these starting values are the \sQuote{best} starting values.  One should use them with caution and should perform sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of different starting values on the final model results.

Starting values for the first parameterization of the Beverton-Holt model were derived by linearizing the function (inverting both sides and simplifying), fitting a linear model to the observed data, and extracting parameter values from the corresponding linear model parameters.  Starting values for the other parameterizations of the Beverton-Holt model were derived from known relationships between the parameters of each parameterization and the first parameterization.  If the computed starting value for the \code{Rp} parameter was larger than the largest observed recruitment value, then the starting value for \code{Rp} was set to the largest observed recruitment value.

Starting values for the Shepherd function were the same as those for the first parameterization of the Beverton-Holt function with the addition that \code{c=1}.

Starting values for the Ricker parameterizations followed the same general procedure as described for the Beverton-Holt parameterizations.  If the computed starting value for \code{atilde} was less than zero then the starting value was set to 0.00001.

Starting values for the Saila-Lorda function were the same as those for the first parameterization of the Ricker function with the addition that \code{c=1}.

Starting values can also be obtained by plotting the data with the model superimposed but tied to slider bars for changing parameters.  One can change the parameters until a reasonable fit is observed and then use those valeus as starting values.  Such a plot can be constructed by including \code{dynamicPlot=TRUE}.  The initial parameters for the slider bars are the starting values constructed as described above.  The range for the sliders will have a minimum that is \code{min,prop} times the initial value and a maximum that is \code{max.mult} times the initial value.  The step or interval of the slider bar is \code{delta.mult} times the initial value.  It should be noted that the dynamic plot may show an error of \dQuote{[tcl] can't get device image} but the plot will correctly update if the slider bar is adjusted.
