\title{Compute measures of precision among sets of ages.}
\usage{
agePrecision(formula, data)

\method{summary}{agePrec}(object, what = c("precision", "difference",
  "absolute difference", "details"), percent = TRUE, trunc.diff = NULL,
  digits = 4, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula of the form \code{~var1+var2+var3+...} or, alternatively, \code{var1~var2+var3+...}, where the \code{varX} generically represent the variables that contain the age assignments.  The alternative formula allows for similar code as used in \code{\link{ageBias}} and can have only one variable on the left-hand side.}

\item{data}{A data.frame that minimally contains the variables in \code{formula}.}

\item{object}{An object of class \code{agePrec}, usually from \code{agePrecision}.}

\item{what}{A string (or vector of strings) that indicates what type of summary to print.  See details.}

\item{percent}{A logical that indicates whether the difference table (see details) should be represented as percentages (\code{TRUE}; default) or frequency (\code{FALSE}) of fish.}

\item{trunc.diff}{A single integer that identifies the age for which all values that age and greater are combined into one category.  See the examples.}

\item{digits}{A single numeric that indicates the minimum number of digits to print when using \code{summary}.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments for methods.}
}
\value{
The main function returns a list with the following items:
\itemize{
  \item detail A data.frame with all data given in \code{data} and intermediate calculations for each fish.  See details
  \item rawdiff A frequency table of fish by differences for each pair of ages.
  \item absdiff A frequency table of fish by absolute differences for each pair of ages.
  \item APE The mean average percent error.
  \item ACV The mean coefficient of variation.
  \item n Number of fish in \code{data}.
  \item R Number of age assessments for each fish given in \code{formula}.
}

The \code{summary} returns the result if \code{what=} contains one item, otherwise it returns nothing.  See details for what is printed.
}
\description{
Computes overall measures of precision for multiple age assignments made on the same individuals.  Ages may be from two or more readers of the same structure, one reader at two or more times, or two or more stuctures (e.g., scales, spines, otoliths).  Measures of precision include ACV (Average Coefficient of Variation), APE (Average Percent Error), and various percentage difference values.
}
\details{
If \code{what="precision"} in \code{summary} then a summary table that contains the following items will be printed:
\itemize{
  \item n Number of fish in \code{data}.
  \item R Number of age assessments given in \code{formula}.
  \item ACV The mean coefficient of variation.  See the \href{http://derekogle.com/IFAR}{IFAR chapter} for calculational details.
  \item APE The mean average percent error.  See the \href{http://derekogle.com/IFAR}{IFAR chapter} for calculational details.
  \item PercAgree The percentage of fish for which all age assignments perfectly agree.
}

If \code{what="difference"} is used in \code{summary} then a table that describes either the percentage (if \code{percent=TRUE}, default) or frequency of fish by the difference in paired age assignments.  This table has one row for each possible pair of age assignments.

If \code{what="absolute difference"} is used in \code{summary} then a table that describes either the percentage (if \code{percent=TRUE}, default) or frequency of fish by the absolute value of the difference in paired age assignments.  This table has one row for each possible pair of age assignments.  The \dQuote{1} column, for example, represents age assignments that disagree by one year (in either direction).

If \code{what="detail"} is used in \code{summary} then a data frame of the original \code{data} along with the intermediate caculations of the average age, standard deviation of age, APE, and ACV for each individual will be printed.  These details are generally only used to check or to understand calculations.

\section{Testing}{
 Tested all precision results against published results in Herbst and Marsden (2011) for the \code{\link{WhitefishLC}} data and the results for the \code{\link[FSAdata]{AlewifeLH}} data set from \pkg{FSAdata} against results from \url{http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/fbp/age-prec/}.

\examples{
## Example with just two age assignments
data(WhitefishLC)
ap1 <- agePrecision(~otolithC+scaleC,data=WhitefishLC)
summary(ap1)
summary(ap1,what="precision")
summary(ap1,what="difference")
summary(ap1,what="difference",percent=FALSE)
summary(ap1,what="absolute")
summary(ap1,what="absolute",percent=FALSE)
summary(ap1,what="absolute",trunc.diff=4)
summary(ap1,what="absolute",percent=FALSE)
summary(ap1,what=c("precision","difference"))

barplot(ap1$rawdiff,ylab="Frequency",xlab="Otolith - Scale Age")
summary(ap1,what="detail")

## Example with three age assignments
ap2 <- agePrecision(~otolithC+finrayC+scaleC,data=WhitefishLC)
summary(ap2)
summary(ap2,what="precision")
summary(ap2,what="difference")
summary(ap2,what="difference",percent=FALSE)
summary(ap2,what="absolute")
summary(ap2,what="absolute",percent=FALSE)
summary(ap2,what="absolute",trunc.diff=4)
summary(ap2,what="absolute",percent=FALSE,trunc.diff=4)
summary(ap2,what="detail")
