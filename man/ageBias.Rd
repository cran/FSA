\value{
\code{ageBias} returns a list with the following items:
\itemize{
  \item data A data.frame with the original paired age estimates and the difference between those estimates.
  \item agree The age-agreement table.
  \item bias A data.frame that contains the bias statistics.
  \item bias.diff A data.frame that contains the bias statistics for the differences.
  \item ref.lab A string that contains an optional label for the age estimates in the columns (reference) of the age-agreement table.
  \item nref.lab A string that contains an optional label for the age estimates in the rows (non-reference) of the age-agreement table.
}

\code{summary} returns the result if \code{what=} contains one item, otherwise it returns nothing. Nothing is returned by \code{plot} or \code{plotAB}, but see details for a description of the plot that is produced.
}
\description{
Constructs age-agreement tables, statistical tests to detect differences, and plots to visualize potential differences in paired age estimates. Ages may be from, for example, two readers of the same structure, one reader at two times, two structures (e.g., scales, spines, otoliths), or one structure and known ages.
}
\details{
Generally, one of the two age estimates will be identified as the \dQuote{reference} set. In some cases this may be the true ages, the ages from the more experienced reader, the ages from the first reading, or the ages from the structure generally thought to provide the most accurate results. In other cases, such as when comparing two novice readers, the choice may be arbitrary. The reference ages will form the columns of the age-agreement table and will be the \dQuote{constant} age used in the t-tests and age bias plots (i.e., the x-axis). See further details below.

The age-agreement table is constructed with  \code{what="table"} in \code{summary}. The agreement table can be \dQuote{flipped} (i.e., the rows in descending rather than ascending order) with \code{flip.table=TRUE}. By default, the tables are shown with zeros replaced by dashes. This behavior can be changed with \code{zero.print}.

Three statistical tests of symmetry for the age-agreement table can be computed with \code{what=} in \code{summary}. The \dQuote{unpooled} or Bowker test as described in Hoenig \emph{et al.} (1995) is constructed with \code{what="Bowker"}, the \dQuote{semi-pooled} or Evans-Hoenig test as described in Evans and Hoenig (1998) is constructed with \code{what="EvansHoenig"}, and the \dQuote{pooled} or McNemar test as described in Evans and Hoenig (1998) is constructed with \code{what="McNemar"}. All three tests are computed with \code{what="symmetry"}.

The age bias plot introduced by Campana \emph{et al.} (1995) can be constructed with \code{\link{plotAB}}. Muir \emph{et al.} (2008) modified the original age bias plot by plotting the difference between the two ages on the y-axis (still against a reference age on the x-axis). McBride (2015) introduced the Bland-Altman plot for comparing fish ages where the difference in ages is plotted on the y-axis versus the mean of the ages on the x-axis. Modifications of these plots are created with \code{plot} (rather than \code{\link{plotAB}}) using \code{xvals=} to control what is plotted on the x-axis (i.e., \code{xvals="reference"} uses the reference ages, whereas \code{xvals="mean"} uses the mean of the two ages for the x-axis). In both plots, a horizontal agreement line at a difference of zero is shown for comparative purposes. In addition, a histogram of the differences is shown in the right margin (can be excluded with \code{yHist=FALSE}.) A histogram of the reference ages is shown by default in the top margin for the modified age bias plot, but not for the modified Bland-Altman-like plot (the presence of this histogram is controlled with \code{xHist=}).

By default, the modified age bias plot shows the mean and range for the nonreference ages at each of the reference ages. Means shown with an open dot are mean age differences that are significantly different from zero. The ranges of differences in ages at each reference age can be removed with \code{show.range=FALSE}. A confidence interval for difference in ages can be added with \code{show.CI=FALSE}. Confidence intervals are only shown if the sample size is greater than the value in \code{min.n.CI=} (also from the original call to \code{\link{ageBias}}). Confidence intervals plotted in red with an open dot (by default; these can be changed with \code{col.CIsig} and \code{pch.mean.sig}, respectively) do not contain the reference age (see discussion of t-tests below). Individual points are plotted if \code{show.pts=TRUE}, where there color is controlled by \code{col.pts=} and \code{transparency=}. See examples for use of these arguments.

The main (i.e., not the marginal histograms) can be "added to" after the plot is constructed if \code{allowAdd=TRUE} is used. For example, the Bland-Altman-like plot can be augmented with a horizontal line at the mean difference in ages, a line for the regression between the differences and the means, or a generalized additive model that describes the relationship between the differences and the means. See the examples for use of \code{allowAdd=TRUE}. It is recommended to save the plotting parameters (e.g., \code{op <- par(no.readonly=TRUE)}) before using \code{plot} with \code{allowAdd=TRUE} so that the original parameters can be reset (e.g., \code{par(op)}); see the examples.

Individual t-tests to determine if the mean age of the nonreference set at a particular age of the reference set is equal to the reference age (e.g., is the mean age of the nonreference set at age-3 of the reference set statistically different from 3?) are shown with \code{what="bias"} in \code{summary}. The results provide a column that indicates whether the difference is significant or not as determined by adjusted p-values from the t-tests and using the significance level provided in \code{sig.level} (defaults to 0.05). Similar results for the difference in ages (e.g., is the mean reference age minus nonreference age at a nonreference age of 3 different from 0?) are constructed with \code{what="diff.bias"} in \code{summary}.

The sample size present in the age-agreement table is found with \code{what="n"}.

 Tested all symmetry test results against results in Evans and Hoenig (2008), the McNemar and Evans-Hoenig results against results from \code{\link[fishmethods]{compare2}} in \pkg{fishmethods}, and all results using the \code{\link[FSAdata]{AlewifeLH}} data set from \pkg{FSAdata} against results from the online resource at http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/fbp/age-prec/.
