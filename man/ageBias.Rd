\value{
\code{ageBias} returns a list with the following items:
\itemize{
  \item data A data.frame with the original paired age assignments and the difference between those assignments.
  \item agree The age-agreement table.
  \item bias A data.frame that contains the bias statistics.
  \item bias.diff A data.frame that contains the bias statistics for the differences.

}

The \code{summary} returns the result if \code{what=} contains one item, otherwise it returns nothing.  Nothing is returned by \code{plot}, but see details for a description of the plot that is produced.
}
\description{
Constructs age-agreement tables, statistical tests to detect bias, and plots to visualize potential bias in paired age assignments.  Ages may be from, for example, two readers of the same structure, one reader at two times, two structures (e.g., scales, spines, otoliths), or one structure and known ages.
}
\details{
Generally, one of the two age estimates will be identified as the \dQuote{reference} set.  In some cases this may be the true ages, the ages from the more experience reader, the ages from the first reading, or the ages from the structure generally thought to provide the most accurate results.  In other cases, such as when comparing two novice readers, the choice may be arbitrary.  The reference ages will form the columns of the age-agreement table and will be the \dQuote{constant} age used in the t-tests and age-bias plots (i.e., the x-axis).  See further details below.

The age-agreement table is constructed with  \code{what="table"} in \code{summary}.  The agreement table can be \dQuote{flipped} (i.e., the rows in descending rather than ascending order) with \code{flip.table=TRUE}.  By default, the tables are shown with zeros replaced by dashes.  This behavior can be changed with \code{zero.print}.

Three statistical tests of symmetry for the age-agreement table can be computed with \code{what=} in \code{summary}.  The \dQuote{unpooled} or Bowker test as described in Hoenig et al. (1995) is constructed with \code{what="Bowker"}, the \dQuote{semi-pooled} or Evans-Hoenig test as described in Evans and Hoenig (1998) is constructed with \code{what="EvansHoenig"}, and the \dQuote{pooled} or McNemar test as described in Evans and Hoenig (1998) is constructed with \code{what="McNemar"}.  All three tests are run simultaneously with \code{what="symmetry"}.

An age-bias plot, as defined by Campana et al. (1995), is constructed with \code{what="bias"} (the default) in \code{plot}.  The reference variable from the \code{ageBias} call is plotted on the x-axis.  Plotted confidence intervals are computed for the mean of the non-reference ages at each of the reference ages.  The level of confidence is controlled by \code{sig.level=} given in the original \code{ageBias} call (i.e., confidence level is 100*(1-\code{sig.level})).  Confidence intervals are only shown if the sample size is greater than the value in \code{min.n.CI=}.  Confidence intervals plotted in red do not contain the reference age (see discussion of t-tests below).  Vertical lines that connect the minimum to the maximum observed value of the y-axis variable at each age of the x-axis variable are plotted in grey if \code{show.range=TRUE}.  Individual points are plotted if \code{show.pts=TRUE}.  The 1:1 (45 degree) agreement line is shown for comparative purposes.  The sample sizes at each age of the x-axis variable are shown if \code{show.n=TRUE} (the default).  The position of the sample sizes is controlled with \code{nYpos=}.

An age-bias plot, as defined by Muir et al. (2008), is constructed as defined above but by also including \code{difference=TRUE} in \code{plot} so that the y-axis is the difference in the paired reference and non-reference ages from the \code{ageBias} call (specifically, nonreference-reference).

The frequency of observations at each unique (x,y) coordinate are shown by using \code{what="numbers"} in \code{plot}.

A \dQuote{sunflower plot}, which contains a symbol for each unique (x,y) coordinate with as many \dQuote{petals} as observations at that point, is constructed with \code{what="sunflower"} in \code{plot}.  A sunflower plot with differences between the two structures can be constructed by also including \code{difference=TRUE}.

Individual t-tests to determine if the mean age of the non-reference set at a particular age of the reference set is equal to the reference age (e.g., is the mean age of the non-reference set at age-3 of the reference set statistically equal to 3?) are shown with \code{what="bias"} in \code{summary}.  The results provide a column that indicates whether the difference is significant or not as determined by adjusted p-values from the t-tests and using the significance level provided in \code{sig.level} (defaults to 0.05).  Similar results for the difference in ages (e.g., is the mean row variable age minus column variable age at column variable age-3 equal to 0?) are constructed with \code{what="diff.bias"} in \code{summary}.

The sample size present in the age-agreement table is found with \code{what="n"}.

\section{Testing}{
 Tested all symmetry test results against results in Evans and Hoenig (2008), the McNemar and Evans-Hoenig results against results from \code{\link[fishmethods]{compare2}} in \pkg{fishmethods}, and all results using the \code{\link[FSAdata]{AlewifeLH}} data set from \pkg{FSAdata} against results from the online resource at http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/fbp/age-prec/.
