\arguments{
\item{key}{A numeric matrix that contains the age-length key.}

\item{type}{A string that indicates the type of plot to construct. See details.}

\item{xlab, ylab}{A string that contains the label for the x- or y-axis.}

\item{xlim, ylim}{A numeric of length 2 that provide the limits for the x-axis or y-axis.}

\item{showLegend}{A logical that indicates whether a legend should be displayed (not implemented for \code{type="bubble"}). See examples.}

\item{lbl.cex}{A numeric character expansion value for labels inside the bars when \code{type="barplot"} or on the lines when \code{type="lines"} or \code{type="splines"}. Only used if \code{showLegend=FALSE}.}

\item{leg.cex}{A numeric character expansion value for labels on the legend when \code{showLegend=TRUE}.}

\item{lwd}{A numeric that indicates the line width when \code{type="lines"} or \code{type="splines"}.}

\item{span}{A numeric that indicates the span value to use in \code{loess} when \code{type="splines"}.}

\item{pal}{A string that indicates the palette to generate colors for the bars, areas, lines, or spline lines. The name of a palette must be one of \dQuote{rich}, \dQuote{cm}, \dQuote{default}, \dQuote{grey}, \dQuote{gray}, \dQuote{heat}, \dQuote{jet}, \dQuote{rainbow}, \dQuote{topo}, or \dQuote{terrain}. See \code{\link{chooseColors}}.}

\item{grid}{A logical that indicates whether a grid should be placed under the bubbles when \code{type="bubble"} or a character or appropriate vector that identifies a color for the grid. See examples.}

\item{col}{A string that indicates the color of the bubbles when \code{type="bubble"}.}

\item{buf}{A single numeric that indicates the relative width of the bubbles when \code{type="bubble"}. A value of 0.5 means that two full-width bubbles would touch each other either in the x- or y-direction (i.e., this would represent half of the minimum of the physical distance between values one-unit apart on the x- and y-axes). Set this to a value less than 0.5 so that the bubbles will not touch (the default is 0.45).}

\item{add}{A logical that indicates whether the data should be added to an already existing plot. May be useful for visually comparing age-length keys. Only implemented when \code{type="bubble"}.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{plot} or \code{barplot}.}

\value{
None, but a plot is constructed.

\description{
Various plots to visualize the proportion of fish of certain ages within length intervals in an age-length key.
}
\details{
A variety of plots can be used to visualize the proportion of fish of certain ages within length intervals of an age-length key. The types of plots are described below and illustrated in the examples.
\itemize{
  \item A \dQuote{stacked} bar chart where vertical bars over length intervals sum to 1 but are segmented by the proportion of each age in that length interval is constructed with \code{type="barplot"}. The ages will be labeled in the bar segments unless \code{showLegend=TRUE} is used.
  \item A \dQuote{stacked} area chart similar to the bar chart described above is constructed with \code{type="area"}.
  \item A plot with (differently colored) lines that connect the proportions of ages within each length interval is constructed with \code{type="lines"}.
  \item A plot with (differently colored) lines, as estimated by loess splines, that connect the proportions of ages within each length interval is constructed with \code{type="splines"}.
  \item A \dQuote{bubble} plot where circles whose size is proportional to the proportion of fish of each age in each length interval is constructed with \code{type="bubble"}. The color of the bubbles can be controlled with \code{col=} and an underlying grid for ease of seeing the age and length interval for each bubble can be controlled with \code{grid=}. Bubbles from a second age-length key can be overlaid on an already constructed bubble plot by using \code{add=TRUE} in a second call to \code{alkPlot}.
}
Note that all plots are \dQuote{vertically conditional} -- i.e., each represents the proportional ages WITHIN each length interval.

## Make an example age-length key
WR.age <- subset(WR79, !is.na(age))
WR.age$LCat <- lencat(WR.age$len,w=5)
raw <- xtabs(~LCat+age,data=WR.age)
( WR.key <- prop.table(raw, margin=1) )
