\usage{
alkMeanVar(
  key,
  formula,
  data,
  len.n,
  method = c("BettoliMiranda", "QuinnDeriso")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{A numeric matrix that contains the age-length key. See details.}

\item{formula}{A formula of the form \code{var~lencat+age} where \code{var} generically represents the variable to be summarized (e.g., length, weight, fecundity), \code{lencat} generically represents the variable that contains the length intervals, and \code{age} generically represents the variable that contains the assigned ages.}

\item{data}{A data.frame that minimally contains the length intervals, assessed ages, and the variable to be summarized (i.e., this should be the aged sample) as given in \code{formula}.}

\item{len.n}{A vector of sample sizes for each length interval in the \emph{complete sample} (i.e., all fish regardless of whether they were aged or not).}

\item{method}{A string that indicates which method of calculation should be used. See details.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with as many rows as ages (columns) present in \code{key} and the following three variables:
\itemize{
  \item age The ages.
  \item mean The mean value at each age.
  \item sd,se The SD if \code{method="BettoliMiranda"} or SE of the mean if \code{method="QuinnDeriso"} for the value at each age.
 }
}
\description{
Computes the mean value-at-age in a larger sample based on an age-length-key created from a subsample of ages through a two-stage random sampling design. The mean values could be mean length-, weight-, or fecundity-at-age, for example. The methods of Bettoli and Miranda (2001) or Quinn and Deriso (1999) are used. A standard deviation is computed for the Bettoli and Miranda (2001) method and standard error for the Quinn and Deriso (1999) method. See the testing section notes.
}
\details{
The age-length key \code{key} must have length intervals as rows and ages as columns. The row names of \code{key} (i.e., \code{rownames(key)}) must contain the minimum values of each length interval (e.g., if an interval is 100-109, then the corresponding row name must be 100). The column names of \code{key} (i.e., \code{colnames(key)}) must contain the age values (e.g., the columns can NOT be named with \dQuote{age.1}, for example).

The length intervals in the rows of \code{key} must contain all of the length intervals present in the larger sample. Thus, the length of \code{len.n} must, at least, equal the number of rows in \code{key}. If this constraint is not met, then the function will stop with an error message.

Note that the function will stop with an error if the formula in \code{formula} does not meet the specific criteria outlined in the parameter list above.
}
\section{Testing}{
 The results of these functions have not yet been rigorously tested. The Bettoli and Miranda (2001) results appear, at least, approximately correct when compared to the results from \code{\link{alkIndivAge}}. The Quinn and Deriso (1999) results appear at least approximately correct for the mean values, but do not appear to be correct for the SE values. Thus, a note is returned with the Quinn and Deriso (1999) results that the SE should not be trusted.

\examples{
## Example -- Even breaks for length categories
WR1 <- WR79
# add length intervals (width=5)
WR1$LCat <- lencat(WR1$len,w=5)
# get number of fish in each length interval in the entire sample
len.n <- xtabs(~LCat,data=WR1)
# isolate aged sample
WR1.age <- subset(WR1, !is.na(age))
# create age-length key
raw <- xtabs(~LCat+age,data=WR1.age)
( WR1.key <- prop.table(raw, margin=1) )

## use age-length key to estimate mean length-at-age of all fish
# Bettoli-Miranda method
alkMeanVar(WR1.key,len~LCat+age,WR1.age,len.n)

# Quinn-Deriso method
alkMeanVar(WR1.key,len~LCat+age,WR1.age,len.n,method="QuinnDeriso")
